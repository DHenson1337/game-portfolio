## About the Game

This is my first attempt at making a video game, and I decided to use it as part of my portfolio!  
The game features a **Blue Wizard** in a **2D platformer** inspired by classic games like Mario.

## Features

- A parallax background for added depth and visual appeal
- A Blue Wizard as the main character
- Gameplay in a cavernous, fantasy-themed environment

## Future Plans

- Expand the environment with collectibles, enemies, and more
- Scale the game to full screen for better immersion
- Create interactive UI elements (e.g., score, health bar)
